## Neon Branch Management Workflow ðŸš€
This GitHub action:
- creates Neon branches for new, reopened, and updated PRs
- resets Neon branches based on the `Reset Neon Branch` label
- deletes Neon branches for closed or merged PRs

Here is an example of how to use it:

```yml
name: Create/Delete/Reset Branch for Pull Request Workflow
run-name: Create/Delete/Reset Branch for Pull Request Workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
      - closed
      - labeled

jobs:
  neon_branch_management:
    name: Create/Delete/Reset Branch for Pull Request Job
    uses: neondatabase/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/neon-preview-branches-for-pull-requests.yml@main
    with: 
      project_id: proud-salad-35321605
    secrets:
      NEON_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
```

The full list of supported parameters can be viewed in the [_neon-preview-branches-for-pull-requests.yml_](/.github/workflows/neon-preview-branches-for-pull-requests.yml) file.
